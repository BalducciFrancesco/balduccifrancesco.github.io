## Nicely-looking dogs

### Samoyedo

*The Samoyedo is a fluffy, friendly, and energetic dog breed known for its iconic smile. It's sincerely impossible to not get good vibes upon seeing one...*

### Chow-Chow

*The Chow-Chow is a dignified and independent breed with a lion-like mane and a unique blue-black tongue. I think this is really the turning point to the overall 15 out of 10 score of this breed.*

### Lapinkoira

*The Lapinkoira is a Finnish herding dog, known for its intelligence, agility, and thick fur coat perfect for cold climates. **My friend Maja has one, and she made me discover it!***

## Not-So-Nicely-looking dogs (only 12 out of 10)

Even if all dogs are, by definition, nice some of them are definitely not my type. Check out the following.

### Chihuahua

*The Chihuahua is definitely the less looking dog among dogs. Its size usually packages anger and hatred for people with unpredictable results.*

### Volpino Italiano

*The Volpino Italiano may seem cute at first, but you will eventually see it constantly barking, ruining your overall dog experience, sadly.*
